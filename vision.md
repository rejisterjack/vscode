# Product Vision: AI-Native Code Editor

## The Problem

Current AI coding tools force developers into uncomfortable trade-offs:

- **Cursor** is closed-source, expensive, and locks you into their AI choices
- **VS Code extensions** (Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code) are limited by extension APIs—slow, constrained, and fighting for UI space
- **Antigravity** abandons the familiar VS Code ecosystem developers rely on

Developers want AI deeply integrated into their editor without sacrificing openness, performance, or choice.

---

## The Vision

An **open-source, AI-native code editor** that feels like the future of development—where AI is woven into every interaction, not bolted on as an afterthought.

Built by forking VS Code and embedding AI capabilities natively, creating an editor that is:

- **Fast** — No extension overhead, instant startup, responsive AI interactions
- **Open** — Apache 2.0 license, community-driven, fully transparent
- **Flexible** — Bring your own AI provider, use any model you prefer
- **Familiar** — Full VS Code compatibility, existing extensions work seamlessly

---

## Core Value Proposition

### For Developers
- **Choice**: Use any of 500+ AI models across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, OpenRouter, or local models
- **Speed**: Native integration means no lag, no loading delays, instant AI assistance
- **Control**: Your code, your AI keys, your data—no vendor lock-in
- **Familiarity**: Everything you love about VS Code, enhanced with AI superpowers

### For Teams
- **Cost Efficiency**: BYOK eliminates per-seat AI tool subscriptions
- **Security**: Use private endpoints, local models, or enterprise AI providers
- **Customization**: Adapt the editor to your workflows, not the other way around

---

## Target Users

**Primary**: Professional developers who:
- Use VS Code as their daily driver
- Want AI assistance without switching editors
- Value open-source tools and data privacy
- Work across multiple projects and tech stacks

**Secondary**: 
- Teams seeking cost-effective AI coding tools
- Developers in regulated industries requiring local/controlled AI
- Open-source contributors and enthusiasts

## Key Differentiators

| Dimension | Our Approach | Market Standard |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Integration Depth** | Native—AI is core to the editor | Extension—AI runs as add-on |
| **Provider Freedom** | 500+ models, any provider | Locked to vendor's choice |
| **Openness** | Fully open-source, Apache 2.0 | Closed-source or limited |
| **Performance** | Optimized, stripped-down core | Bloated with legacy features |
| **Community** | Community-driven development | Corporate-controlled roadmap |

## Product Principles

1. **AI-First, Not AI-Bolted-On**
   - Every feature designed with AI assistance in mind
   - Context-aware, intelligent defaults
   - Predictive, not just reactive

2. **Developer Sovereignty**
   - Your keys, your models, your data
   - No artificial limitations or paywalls
   - Full control over AI behavior

3. **Invisible Complexity**
   - Powerful features that feel simple
   - Smart defaults, deep customization when needed
   - Performance that stays out of your way

4. **Ecosystem Compatibility**
   - VS Code extensions work unchanged
   - Familiar keyboard shortcuts and workflows
   - Seamless migration path

## The Experience

Imagine an editor where:

- AI suggestions appear instantly as ghost text, contextually aware of your entire codebase
- Complex refactoring happens through natural conversation—"Extract this into a service class"—with the AI understanding your project's patterns
- Debugging becomes collaborative—AI traces execution, suggests fixes, explains errors in context
- Your codebase is automatically indexed and searchable by meaning, not just text
- Multiple AI modes adapt to your task—coding, architecting, debugging, learning

All without leaving your editor. All at the speed of thought. All under your control.

---

## Success Looks Like

- Developers choose this editor for AI features, stay for the performance and openness
- Active community contributing modes, providers, and improvements
- Recognized as the definitive open-source AI coding tool
- Teams standardize on it for cost savings and security compliance

---

## Why Now

The AI coding assistant market is fragmented between:
- Closed, expensive tools (Cursor)
- Limited extension-based solutions (Cline, Roo, Kilo)
- Immature new editors (Antigravity)

Developers are ready for an open, performant, deeply integrated alternative that respects their workflow and their freedom.

*This is not just another editor with AI features. This is the editor AI-native development deserves.*
