## 🚀 The Vision

**FewStepAway** is an open-source, AI-native code editor that feels like the future of development—where AI is woven into every interaction, not bolted on as an afterthought.

Built by forking VS Code and embedding AI capabilities natively, creating an editor that is:

- **Fast** — No extension overhead, instant startup, responsive AI interactions
- **Open** — Apache 2.0 license, community-driven, fully transparent
- **Flexible** — Bring your own AI provider, use any model you prefer
- **Familiar** — Full VS Code compatibility, existing extensions work seamlessly

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

| Dimension | FewStepAway | Market Standard |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Integration Depth** | Native—AI is core to the editor | Extension—AI runs as add-on |
| **Provider Freedom** | 500+ models, any provider | Locked to vendor's choice |
| **Openness** | Fully open-source, Apache 2.0 | Closed-source or limited |
| **Performance** | Optimized, stripped-down core | Bloated with legacy features |
| **Community** | Community-driven development | Corporate-controlled roadmap |
